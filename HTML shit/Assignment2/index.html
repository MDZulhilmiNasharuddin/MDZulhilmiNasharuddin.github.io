                Swords are long-edged bladed weapons that have served as primary offensive arms since the Bronze Age. A typical sword consists of a blade, guard, grip, and pommel, often housed in a scabbard for protection. Early swords began as straight, double-edged designs for both cutting and thrusting, while later developments introduced curved forms—such as sabers and scimitars—optimized for slashing on horseback. Across cultures, these variations reflect advances in metallurgy, shifting battlefield tactics, and local artistic traditions.

                Traditional swords were forged from bronze, iron, and eventually high-carbon steel, employing techniques like pattern welding or differential hardening to balance sharpness with flexibility. Beyond their martial role, swords have embodied honor and authority in ceremonies and mythology—from the katana of samurai Japan to the longsword of medieval Europe. In the modern era, they live on in fencing (foil, épée, saber), historical reenactment, and as collectible works of craftsmanship. Though obsolete on today’s battlefield, swords continue to captivate through their technical artistry, cultural symbolism, and enduring presence in literature and film
